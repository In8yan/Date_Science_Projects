**Car Dataset Data Analysis**

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on the cleaning and transformation of a comprehensive cars dataset using Python and Pandas. 
The analysis demonstrates essential data science workflows, including handling missing values, filtering categorical data, and applying mathematical transformations to improve data quality for further modeling.

**Key Objectives**
Following questions are answered in the analysis:
  1) Find all Null Values in the dataset. If there is any null value in any column, then fill it with the mean of that column.
  2)  Check what are the different types of Make are there in our dataset. And, what is the count (occurrence) of each Make in the data ?
  3)  Show all the records where Origin is Asia or Europe.
  4)  Remove all the records (rows) where Weight is above 4000.
  5)  Increase all the values of 'MPG_City' column by 3.

**Tech Stack**
  Language: Python 3.x
  Libraries: Pandas
  Tools: Jupyter Notebook
