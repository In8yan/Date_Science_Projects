**Car Dataset Data Analysis**

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on the cleaning and transformation of a comprehensive cars dataset using Python and Pandas. 
The analysis demonstrates essential data science workflows, including handling missing values, filtering categorical data, and applying mathematical transformations to improve data quality for further modeling.

**Key Objectives**
The project is divided into several technical stages:
  Imputation (Data Cleaning): Detecting null values and applying mean imputation to maintain dataset integrity.
  Frequency Analysis: Utilizing value counts to understand the market share of various car manufacturers (Make).
  Logical Filtering: Extracting specific subsets of data based on geographical origin (Asia and Europe).
  Outlier Removal: Streamlining the dataset by removing heavy-weight vehicles (Weight > 4000) to focus on specific vehicle classes.
  Feature Transformation: Applying functional updates to columns (increasing MPG_City) to simulate performance adjustments or normalization.

**Tech Stack**
  Language: Python 3.x
  Libraries: Pandas
  Tools: Jupyter Notebook
