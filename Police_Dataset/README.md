**Police Dataset Analysis**
## Project Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of a police stop dataset to uncover patterns in traffic violations and law enforcement interactions. 
By using Python and Pandas, the study explores the relationships between gender, age, and violation types, while emphasizing critical data cleaning steps like column removal and data-type transformation.

## Key Objectives
The following tasks and questions guide this analysis:
 1)  Remove the column that only contains missing values.
 2) For Speeding, were Men or Women stopped more often?
 3)  Does gender affect who gets searched during a stop?
 4)  What is the mean stop_duration?
 5) Compare the age distributions for each violation.
