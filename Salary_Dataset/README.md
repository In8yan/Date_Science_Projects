**Salary Dataset Analysis**
## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global salary trends across various industries and job roles. 
The primary goal is to identify the key factors—such as location, company rating, and employment type—that influence compensation. 
The workflow follows a rigorous data science pipeline, moving from initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and rigorous data cleaning to advanced visualization and outlier detection.

## Key Objectives
The analysis is structured around the following core competencies and milestones:
✅ Data Understanding & Exploration (EDA): Initial assessment of dataset structure and variables.
✅ Data Cleaning & Handling Duplicates: Ensuring data integrity by removing redundancies and formatting errors.
✅ Outlier Detection using IQR Method: Identifying and managing extreme values to prevent skewed analysis.
✅ Data Visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn: Creating clear and impactful visual representations of data.
✅ Business Questions & Insights: Translating data patterns into actionable business intelligence.
✅ Correlation Analysis: Measuring the strength of relationships between numerical variables.
✅ Advanced Charts (Scatter, Line, Histogram, Dashboard): Implementing sophisticated plotting techniques for deeper insights.
✅ Final Mini Dashboard: Consolidating findings into a cohesive, portfolio-ready visual summary.
